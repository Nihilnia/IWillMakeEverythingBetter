/*
!Basically, 
when you define a variable your machine hold a value in the RAM for it. 
But when you want to change that variable that RAM value (address lets say) is changing. 
Because of being primitive types.

But its not the case for reference objects (objects, arrays, functions)
When you make a change javaScript finds that address in the RAM and changes the values of, not the address.
